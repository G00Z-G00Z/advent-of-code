# 2022 Rust 

**Started**: 7/June/2023
**Finished**: ...

This year I'll be focusing on [Rust][rust_website]. I've an interest for the
language because I think it will have a lot of application in the robotics
field, due to its performace and more modern features than c++. 

## Developers

Feel free to use every code I produce. Also, I made a "utility-2022" package
with common functionality that can be shared amongst days. Just add in the
day's `Cargo.toml` the following line: 

```toml
[dependencies]
utility-2022 = { path = "../utility-2022" }
```

This will let you have access to the utility functions.
